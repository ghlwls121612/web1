What is it about them?<br>
I must be missing something<br>
They just keep doing nothing<br>
Too intoxicated to be scared<br>
Better off without them<p></p>
They're nothing but unstable<br>
Bring ashtrays to the table<br>
And that's about the only thing they share<p></p>
I'm in their second hand smoke<br>
Still just drinking canned coke<br>
I don't need a xanny to feel better<br>
On designated drives home<br>
Only one who's not stoned<br>
Don't give me a xanny now or ever<p></p>
Waking up at sundown<br>
They're late to every party<br>
Nobody's ever sorry<br>
Too inebriated now to dance<p></p>
Morning as they come down (come down)<br>
Their pretty heads are hurting (hurting)<br>
They're awfully bad at learning (learning)<br>
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance<p></p>
I'm in their second hand smoke<br>
Still just drinking canned coke<br>
I don't need a xanny to feel better<br>
On designated drives home<br>
Only one who's not stoned<br>
Don't give me a xanny now or ever<br>
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk<br>
On your cigarette break<br>
I can't afford to love someone<br>
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake<p></p>
What is it about them?<br>
I must be missing something<br><br>
They just keep doing nothing<br>
Too intoxicated to be scared<p></p>
Hmm, hmm<br>
Hmm, hmm<br>
Hmm, mmm<br>
Come down, hurting<br>
Learning
