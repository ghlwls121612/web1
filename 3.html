My Lucifer is lonely<p></p>
Standing there, killing time<br>
Can't commit to anything but a crime<br>
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation<br>
Animals, evidence<br>
Pearly gates look more like a picket fence<br>
Once you get inside 'em<br>
Got friends but can't invite them<p></p>
Hills burn in California<br>
My turn to ignore ya<br>
Don't say I didn't warn ya<p></p>
All the good girls go to hell<br>
'Cause even God herself has enemies<br>
And once the water starts to rise<br>
And heaven's out of sight<br>
She'll want the devil on her team<p></p>
My Lucifer is lonely<p></p>
Look at you needing me<br>
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery<br>
Walk in wearing fetters<br>
Peter should know better<br>
Your cover up is caving in<br>
Man is such a fool<br>
Why are we saving him?<br>
Poisoning themselves now<br>
Begging for our help, wow!<p></p>
Hills burn in California<br>
My turn to ignore ya<br>
Don't say I didn't warn ya<p></p>
All the good girls go to hell<br>
'Cause even God herself has enemies<br>
And once the water starts to rise<br>
And heaven's out of sight<br>
She'll want the devil on her team<p></p>
My Lucifer is lonely<p></p>
There's nothing left to save now<br>
My god is gonna owe me<br>
There's nothing left to save now<br>
